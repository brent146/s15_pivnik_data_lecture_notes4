Git Presentation:

Must be careful of what branch you're in. 

git status -b allows you to see all the files in the current repository

Non-Tracked Files (executables, files that you don't wish to be part of your repository)

These are usually handled via a file called .gitignore (removes unwated files)

fetch -get the changes but do not integrate

reset - move the current head

tag - mark git objects

mv - move a file location within a repository
